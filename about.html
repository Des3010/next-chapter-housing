      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>Our mission is to provide a safe, supportive, and structured environment for vulnerable young people aged 16–18 who are preparing for independent living. We believe that every young person deserves not just a roof over their head, but a place to grow, thrive, and find their next chapter.</p>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 30px;">Our Vision</h2>
      <p>We envision a society where every young person has access to high-quality support, compassionate mentorship, and the tools needed to confidently transition into adulthood.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Meet Our Team</h2>
  <div style="margin-top: 20px;">
    <p>At the heart of Next Chapter Housing is a team of dedicated professionals with over two decades of combined experience in supporting vulnerable young people. Our leadership team comprises experts in children’s services, social care, housing management, and youth development — many of whom have worked hand-in-hand with local authorities and councils across the UK.</p>

    <p>We understand the complex needs of young people who may be leaving care, navigating trauma, or simply in need of a stable and nurturing environment. That’s why our team blends professional expertise with genuine empathy — ensuring that each resident receives not only structured support but also compassion, consistency, and respect.</p>

    <p>Our staff undergo continuous training in safeguarding, trauma-informed care, and youth mental health. This helps us deliver care that is not just compliant with regulatory standards but deeply person-centred.</p>

    <p>Whether it's working with social workers to create tailored support plans or offering a listening ear during challenging times, our team is here to walk every step of the journey with our young people — helping them build confidence, resilience, and a strong foundation for independent living.</p>
